                But now, in this era,  Kesha is no longer a third person or second choice; she is the first and only choice.
                So let's welcome back Kesha cause she is here to stay. This webpage is important to me because, hopefully,
                I can reach someone out there who is searching for themselves as well. Just know, "if you lose something,
                it can be found..." That's a direct quote from Turkeisha, aka Kesha. Stay tuned... Up next is my journey through
                adulthood, a college graduate with three kids and a divorcee who lives life with who is for me and cares for me. See ya
                next year with an update!</h3>
