        <p>
            Who is Kesha? is what I learned to ask myself. Sometimes I wonder if they really see me or if they look past me. Honestly, 
            sometimes I can't tell. For those who do not know me, I  am what you would call a professional loner. I have few friends, 
            but at the same time, I am surrounded by a bunch of extras lol. But seriously, I love to laugh and sleep and shop, but on 
            a budget! Of course you know I don't have to be in front of the camera, but even if I am behind the camera, you will see me.
