        <p><h4>
            When I was growing up, I always said I wanted to be a lawyer and marry rich with no kids, 
            but I did the total opposite, and nothing is wrong with that. However,  it shows you how 
            green you can be when you're a kid. My younger self would tell me to live it up, meet now, 
            have a run, and stop worrying about adult things when you're not even an adult yet.</h4>
            </p>
        <p><h4>As a kid, I loved playing with Bratz. My favorite character was Sasha because she matched mine. 
            She was my twin, and she was even real, but that's called a great imagination, okay?</h4></p>
