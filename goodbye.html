			    of a 30-year-old. She’s bold, loud, and, trust me, 
			    I’m very proud of her.</p>

<p class="text">Her favorite colors are purple and pink. When asked what she wants 
	to be when she grows up, she says she doesn’t know—so stay tuned!</p>

			    but has the heart and soul of a 65-year-old. He runs 
			    around all day, grabbing and climbing on everything, 
			    with no intention of slowing down. We’re working on 
			    potty training—ask me how it’s going. Guess what? 
			    It’s going great, yay! He’s turning 2 soon, and I’m 
			    looking forward to all the memories we’ll make.</p>
