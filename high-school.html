                <h3>
                    Now, as we move on to my teenage years...<br>
                    Everybody says, "Hey, Kesha!" because I walked into the high school with my head up high, and my confidence was on ten as a freshman.
                    I didn't have an awkward face, but I did have a phase where I thought my body was changing, I was a little unprepared for
                    the attention of the boys and girls. They were nice, but then others were just trying to get lucky. I went to school
                    with my brothers, so I did not have to worry too much; everyone knew they were not playing games about me. The girls were
                    just faking, like, how are you mad that your boyfriend is talking to me? I can't help being a likable person lol! But, seriously,
                    high school overall was a time that I look back on and remember things, like prom and graduation and the feeling of walking the
                    red carpet with all eyes on me. If I could live that time again, I would do it. This is part of the reason why I am trying
                    my hardest to graduate this May for one, I always said I was going to graduate from college and also wanted to hear my name
                    called and show everybody that I did it not just for me but for my family.

                <h3>
                    High school prepared me for my early twenties. Everything that I didn't do in high school I experienced, like dating,
                    just becoming more sociable, the feeling of not caring and living life with no responsibility. You couldn't tell me anything.
                    Honestly, I was selfish and sure and proud of myself. I loved her! While living my life at 19, I
                    became pregnant. I was no longer Kesha; I was Mom, and that took me on a journey that I  thought I was truly ready for, which,
                    in turn, was a lot of surprises, good and bad. In 7 years, I had three kids plus my angel baby, who I think about all the time.
                    My twenties have been spent as a single mother, a married mother who was still a single mother, and a soon-to-be divorced
                    mother who doesn't love motherhood. I lost a part of me when I started putting myself last.
